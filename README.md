# Jest Node.js Example Showcase

Welcome to the Jest Node.js Example Showcase! This repository serves as a demonstration of how to set up and use Jest for testing Node.js applications. Jest is a delightful JavaScript testing framework that focuses on simplicity and ease of use.

This repository provides a simple example of using Jest to test a Node.js application. It includes basic configurations and examples to help you kickstart your testing journey with Jest. Whether you are new to Jest or looking for a reference, this showcase is designed to guide you through the process.

## Getting Started

To get started with this example showcase, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaseMax/jest-nodejs-example-showcase.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd jest-nodejs-example-showcase
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Project Structure

The project structure is designed to be simple and easy to understand. Here's a brief overview:

`__tests__/`: Houses the Jest test files corresponding to the source code.
`package.json`: Includes project dependencies and scripts for running tests.
`jest.config.js`: Jest configuration file with settings for test execution.

Feel free to modify the project structure based on your preferences and project requirements.

## Running Tests

Run the following command to execute the Jest tests:

```bash
npm test
npm run watchtest
```

This will trigger Jest to run all the tests in the `__tests__`/ directory. You can also use additional Jest CLI options to customize the test execution.

## Configuration

The Jest configuration can be defined in the `jest.config.js` file. This file includes settings such as test environment, test match patterns, and other configuration options. Feel free to customize this file according to your project's needs.
